A Colorado Board of Elections employee gave the following task of completing an election audit for a recent local congressional election. The purpose of the audit was to investiage which counties voted, how much they voted, and who they voted for. The data came from the election_results.csv file and the analysis was performed using Python.

- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.

  - Charles Casper Stockham

## Challenge Summary

This script can be used to analyze the number of votes cast and where they were cast from for any local, state, or federal election, given the proper data file is collected. For a local election, counties could be switched with districts to view a more precise scope of voters. For a federal election, counties could be switched with states to see a broader scope of how the nation voted.
